# ML4CEATesting

Explore patient and physician characteristics that provide insights into the likelihood of a patient undergoing testing in the next three months.
ML4CEATesting is an interactive software system designed to help clinicians identify patients for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing using a machine learning model.
Use the URL to access the interactive website to input values to get prediction: [https://ceatestingmodel.streamlit.app/]

Installation
------------

To install `ml4cea` you will need to begin by cloning `ml4cea` on your own computer by using the following `git` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ML4CEA/CEATestingModel.git
```

Next, to install the package, run the `setup.py` file:

```
python setup.py install
```

To ensure that the dependencies to run `ml4cea` are installed on your computer you will want to run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be ready to import and use `ml4cea` on your computer.

Examples
--------

To understand how to use ml4cea, please refer to
the [examples](https://github.com/ML4CEA/CEATestingModel/tree/main/examples) section of this GitHub page where you can find
examples for doing the following:

- How to generate the trained model based on the user input data
- How to use the interactive website to predict a patient's likelihood of being tested within the next three months
- How to update the trained model based on user input and use the interactive website to predict a patient's likelihood of being tested within the next three months

Tests
-----

Run the command in the root directory:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Folder structure
----------------

Repository is structered as below. 

Data required for model training can be found under ``data``

Data merging and cleaning can be found under ``ml4cea/create_variable.py`` and ``ml4cea/data_clean.py``.

Model can be found under ``ml4cea/model.py``.

Tests can be found under ``tests`` folder.

Examples for using the prediction portal can be found at ``examples/ folder``

Background
-------------
Patients who have completed curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) should be followed up for the development of recurrent disease and require surveillance for five years post-treatment. <br>
<br>
**Clinical guidelines**: Suggest carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing every three to six months <br>
**Statement of the Problem**: In practice, patients do not receive frequent testing <br>
**Opportunity**: Increase adherence to guideline-recommended testing; reduce cost <br>
**Aim**:  <br>
    - Identify patient and physician characteristics that predict a patient's likelihood of being tested in the next three months <br>
    - Build an interactive software system designed to help clinicians and policymakers with identifying patients for CEA testing using the model <br>
<br>
